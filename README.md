1. What happens when you press the “submit” button? Paste the full URL you are sent to on submit.
- The data entered is sent to the accepting variable that stores the information. file:///results?FirstName=potato&LastName=tomato&animal=dog&favcolor=%238be5ff&vehicle2=Honda&vehicle3=BMW

2. What are the keys of this URL query string? How do they correspond to the “name” fields of your HTML form elements?
- The names in the query string are the variables the answers are stored into.

3. What are the values of the URL query string? How do they correspond to what the user entered or typed?
- The values are what the user typed and stored into the keys from the backend code.



Stretch challenge question:
Is there a way to pass multiple values through the URL query string for a single key? How can we do so?
- I think it is possible by creating a singular array.
